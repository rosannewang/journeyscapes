# Journeyscapes

## Description
This project is a travel journaling app that allows users to create and store journal entries on their local computer.


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
